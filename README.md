## html basics
HTML works in a simple way,<br>
you have built-in "classes", some example ones are:
- Paragraph
- Headline
- Bold

<br>Those are pretty straightforward,<br>
To set up a starting point, every "object" is surrounded by angle brackets,<br>
or `<>`, so for example:
<Start paragraph>Hello!<end paragraph><br>
`Note: this isnt actual syntax, its just an example.`<br>
how you would actually proceed would be like so:<br>
```html
<p
```
<b><b>Note: `<p>` is for paragraph</b>
