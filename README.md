## HTML basics
HTML works in a simple way,<br>
you have built-in "classes", some example ones are:
- Paragraph
- Headline
- Bold

<br>Those are pretty straightforward,<br>
To set up a starting point, every "object" is surrounded by angle brackets,<br>
or `<>`, so for example:
`<Start-paragraph>Hello!<end-paragraph>`<br>
Note: this isnt actual syntax, its just an example.<br>
how you would actually proceed would be like so:<br>
```html
<p>Hello world!</p>
```
<b><b>Note: `<p>` is for paragraph</b><br>
Now, you could see you start by doing `<p>`, to indicate you want a paragraph.<br>
and `</p>`, notice the slash P, indicating to end the paragraph.

## Cheat Sheet
| Class       | Description     |
|------------|----------------|
| `<p>`     | Paragraph       |
| `<b>`        | Bold       |
| `<br>`    | Newline |
| `<h>`      | Header |
| `<i>`      | Italic |
<br>
Notice: a lot of real life html classes don't work inside grey hack.<br>
but search actual html on google and try things out, thats how you find out new things!.
```
Fun fact: <br> doesnt need closing, its basically like using \n in coding
just do <br> without </br> and it will go down a line without causing problems!
```

## examples
